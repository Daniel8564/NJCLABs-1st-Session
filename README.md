Q&amp;A about Agile, SCRUM and SDLC


1)	Explain SDLC at a high level
SDLC is software development life cycle which includes necessary steps to develop software or any project. To do SDLC, there are two approaches, the traditional method of waterfall and the Agile/SCRUM method. The phases generally include requirement analysis, design, development, testing and maintenance. 

2)	What is waterfall and why it is still relevant
Waterfall is traditional method of SDLC and includes phases which should be completed sequentially. The phases are Analysis, Design, Development, Testing and Maintenance. The issue with that is each steps should be completed to go forward to the proceeding steps and each step cannot perform in parallel with other steps. In today’s industry if there is a clear plan from initial step, waterfall model can be used. However, client feedback at the final step cannot be implemented as it needs to start from initial step and add to the overall fixed budget.

3)	Explain Agile Model with a use case and the role of SCRUM in that
When the whole project is divided into small sections in where the whole steps of SDLC are preformed it is called agile model. i.e. if a total time frame of a project is 12 months and if in each months the whole steps of waterfall model is performed and then the client can give his/her feedback each month, it is called agile model. Scrum is the framework that agile model is implemented. 

4)	Who is Scrum Master
Scrum Master is other name of project manager. He manages the project and is the connector between the team members/development team and product owner.

5)	Differentiate between Product/Sprint Backlog
The product backlog compiles all the features that should be done to complete the whole project according to the product owner comments. The sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog but it contains the tasks that should be completed during each sprint which is often over a period of two weeks. 

6)	What is Epic & Story
Epics are large body of works that should be completed. Each epic can be divided to a number of smaller tasks called stories.

7)	What is called Velocity in SCRUM
Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a team can complete during a single sprint. i.e. if the development team has finished a total of 60 points/stories over two sprints, the team’s velocity is 30 per sprint.

8)	Explain the SCRUM ceremonies
Scrum ceremonies ensure that everyone including scrum master, product owner and development team is in-sync. It includes sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospective.

9)	What is grooming
Grooming is a meeting of the scrum team in which the product backlog items are discussed and the next sprint planning is prepared. This includes preparing epics and stories.

10)	How Jira board is effective in SCRUM
Jira is the framework the scrum is implemented in it. So in Jira, the sprints are created.

11)	Differentiate between SCRUM & Waterfall
Waterfall is the traditional way of SDLC and it involves steps that should be completed linearly and sequentially. The stakeholder and customers feedback can be implemented at the initial requirement of project and their feedback cannot be implemented in each stage of development. Waterfall method is more suitable for simple project. Whereas SCRUM is the modern approach of SDLC and is the same as Agile. Via SCRUM the complex project can be completed and customer feedback can be implemented during each step of SDLC.

12)	Explain the responsibilities of Product Owner
The product owner is a member of Agile team and responsible for defining stories and prioritizing the team backlog. Outside of local team, PO
